NapChat is a social utility app designed to allow users to create sleep alarms that can send auto notifications
to a group of friends to notify them that they are sleeping. As well this app can be used to track sleeping patterns and
also as a personal sleep alarm. This app will target students for exam time, people with roomates, shift workers such as nurses doctors
and people in trades. Also coaches for sports teams when on the road or nights before games to help tell their athletes when to sleep
and when to wake up. Other applications could be wedding parties, family schedules, funerals, catching flights, business flights/trips.

## Lean Startup Approach
### Hypothesis
 - **Value hypothesis'** (_tests whether a product or service really delivers value to a customer once they use it._)
     - People want to know the facts about health found through credible research institutions.
     - People want to be shown an indication of where these so called "studies" are coming from.
     - People want to be able to learn more about those studies without having to search for them.
     - People would like to be able to notify certain contacts that they shouldn't be disturbed in order to protect the integrity of their sleeping habits.
 - **Growth Hypothesis'**(_tests how a new customer will discover our product or service._)
     - People will prefer to switch to our product if it provides an aspect that competitors don't offer even if it doesn't relate to the main function of the app.
     - People will find the app based on similar naming to Snapchat
     - People will recommend the application to thier friends in order to utilize the messaging system.
### Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop
This process will dictate the overall process of iteration with our product. Our goal through each iteration is to minimize the amount of time in each cycle.
 - IDEAS -> BUILD -> PRODUCT -> MEASURE -> DATA -> LEARN -> ...
  - IDEAS - features to implement into the product
  - BUILD - construct the next iteration.
  - PRODUCT - produce the product
  - MEASURE - determine the important things to qunatify, measure, and log.
  - DATA - analyze the data
  - LEARN - Learn, pivot, or perservere based on data.
